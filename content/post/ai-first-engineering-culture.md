The engineers most resistant to AI are often your most senior. They're also the ones you need to win over first.

You probably believe that AI is a huge productivity boost for engineers. And that engineers who do not adopt AI will find themselves with a huge disadvantage in the near future, or even out of job.

You have a really valid point there. But why is that claim not enough to move the needle?

In every org, there are the "**AI skeptical**" engineers.

These are usually the more senior folks, and those that tend to be more technical than others.

They are the ones who've seen many phases of hype over their careers, and they developed a mature level of skepticism. They say AI is too hyped.

To get your engineering team to be AI-first, you have to **win them over**. Because these skeptics are often the more senior folks, they tend to lead and influence where the wind is blowing within their teams. If you make them AI-first, others will follow.

As a manager, you may think "they don't want to use AI because they are afraid it will replace them", or other similar thoughts.

That's mostly not true. I've talked to a lot of them, and as a technical skeptical person myself, I can understand why they developed that skepticism. To win them over, you need to understand their way of thinking.

### Why They're Skeptical

Imagine the process they have gone through that reinforced their skepticism:

- They played with vibe-coding a few times, and it ended up as a big ball of mud. They know the meaning of it - they can't maintain it over time, and it's a tech debt factory.

- All of their LinkedIn feed is filled with non-technical influencers who keep bragging about AI ("I made a website in 5 minutes, it's the end of software engineering", "I can do everything with n8n, no-code for the win")

- AI-slop is everywhere.

- Some of them may have already handed over vibe-coded code built in 2 hours by non-technical folks asking them to make it "production-ready" and they know that it's a ticking time-bomb. They know that if they take ownership of that, they invite chaos.

They are not wrong there. These skeptical folks have some good points, because they **care about production and high-quality**, they want to keep the tech reliable and working so that the **business will prosper**.
They know the devil is in the details, and the concerning things that they see can't always be seen from up above.

But they are wrong in allowing the skepticism to control them, preventing them from adopting AI and gaining productivity boost.

So how do you actually move them? I can share what worked for me.

I was never a big coding enthusiast; I cared more about architecture, and coding was just a tool. Around the same time, I was building AI agents, so I understood the potential.

I forced myself to stop writing code manually for a while and lean fully on AI. It was clunky at first, but after a period of experimenting, I noticed I was genuinely more productive. The key insight: AI-generated code is verifiable. Once you put a senior engineer in the loop, it becomes controllable.

That's when I started treating AI as a **copilot that helps me brainstorm, plan, and execute on my terms**—and it stuck. But I needed that trial and error period to get there.

When I was working with teams to help them adopt AI-assisted coding, that skeptical pattern became clear to me, and I knew how to approach them because I can speak their language and see them eye-to-eye. And that builds trust.

## Tips on AI-coding enablement

### ✅ Do

1. Find skeptical engineers who've become passionate AI adopters—people respected by their peers. Let them lead this effort while you sponsor and support them.

2. Talk to team leads to give engineers time to learn and experiment. AI-assisted coding is not vibe-coding—it's a skill that takes time to develop. Expect an initial dip in productivity before you see the gains.

3. Develop healthy skepticism yourself. When someone shows you a sexy demo built using AI in a few hours, dig deeper—ask the skeptics what's rotting under the hood.

### ❌ Don't

1. Don't call AI coding as vibe-coding. Terminology can trigger emotions. Vibe-coding is when the code doesn't matter. Not every AI coding is vibe coding. There are much safer and reliable ways to do AI coding for production. You can call it AI-assisted coding.

2. Don't dismiss the skeptical. Listen to them and understand their perspective, give them time, but challenge them, because they must adapt to the new world.

3. Don't allow non-engineers to hand over vibe-coded solutions and expect engineers to deploy them to production. Make it clear: vibe-coded work is for POCs and reference only. Engineers who own production systems shouldn't be bypassed. This is exactly the kind of thing that reinforces your skeptics' distrust—and proves them right.

🎯 The AI-first transformation requires both top-down and bottom-up—leadership support *and* buy-in from the people closest to the code. Neither alone is enough. As a manager, you're the bridge—and your skeptics are the first ones to bring across. Win them, and you win the team.
